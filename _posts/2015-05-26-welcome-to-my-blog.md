     <h3>My GSoC trip</h3>
     <p>I'm glad to have a chance to join 2015 Google Summer of Code, and this is my first time to join it.</p>
     <p>During these three month, I will contribute to a project called self-hosted online communities communication with OTR encryption with an Indian girl, my mentors and some other people from FOSSASIA.</p>
     <h3>This blog is for what?</h3>
     <p>This page is used to illustrate my idea and conclude my work every Friday from this week.</p>

     <p>So, let's begin!!!</p>
